# stopwatch
I developed a fully functional Stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features a clean and responsive user interface with real-time time tracking capabilities.

It includes essential stopwatch functionalities such as Start, Stop, and Reset, allowing users to measure elapsed time accurately. The time is displayed in HH:MM:SS:MS format and updates in real time using JavaScript logic.

This project demonstrates my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and timer functions in JavaScript.
